                                    <i>- Regarding Arbitration -</i></p>


                                    <p><i>THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC</i><br>
                                    <i>Let it be known that the National Congress decrees and I ratify the following law:</i></p> 

                                    <h5>CHAPTER I</h5>
                                    <p>GENERAL PROVISIONS</p> 

                                    <p>Article 1 - Persons capable of entering into contracts will be able to avail themselves of arbitration in order to resolve disputes relating to freely transferable property rights.</p> 

                                    <p>Article  2 - Arbitration may be in law or ex aequo et bono , depending on the will of the parties.</p> 

                                    <p>§ 1 - The parties may freely choose the rules of law to be applied in arbitration, as long as there is no violation of good customs and public order.<br>
                                    § 2 - The parties may also stipulate that the arbitration be based on the general principles of law, customs and usages and the rules of international trade.</p> 

                                    <h5>CHAPTER II</h5>
                                    <p>THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND ITS EFFECTS</p> 

                                    <p>Article 3 - The parties can submit their disputes to arbitration by virtue of the arbitration agreement, being such the arbitration clause and the submission agreement. (compromis)</p> 

                                    <p>Article 4 - An arbitration clause is an agreement by which the parties to a contract undertake to submit to arbitration the disputes which may arise with respect to that contract.</p> 

                                    <p>§ 1 - The arbitration clause shall be in writing and it can be inserted in the main contract or in a document to which it refers.<br>
                                    § 2 - In adhesion contracts, the arbitration clause shall not be deemed to have efficacy unless the adherent takes the initiative to initiate arbitration proceedings or agrees expressly to its initiation as long as it is in writing or in an attached document or in bold, with a signature or endorsement made specially for this clause.</p> 

                                    <p>Article 5 - When the arbitration clause makes reference to the rules of a particular arbitral institution or specialised entity, the arbitration shall be instituted and conducted in accordance with such rules, unless otherwise agreed by the parties.</p> 

                                    <p>Article 6 - In the event of absence of provision as to the method of initiating the arbitration, the interested party shall serve the other party with a written notice by registered letter or by any other means which provides a record of delivery, calling for the other party to appear at a set date, time and place in order to sign the compromis .</p> 

                                    <p>Sole Paragraph: Where the party to whom notice is served fails to appear or refuses to sign thecompromis , the other party can, pursuant to article 7 of this law, seek assistance from the Judicial Court which originally would have had jurisdiction to hear the case.</p> 

                                    <p>Article 7 - Where there is an arbitration clause but one of the parties shows resistance as to the initiation of arbitration, the interested party may request a subpoena for the other party  to appear in court in order to prepare the compromis , with the judge designating a special hearing for such a purpose.</p> 

                                    <p>§ 1 - The claimant shall indicate precisely the object of the arbitration, including the document which contains the arbitration clause.<br> 
                                    § 2 - The judge, previously to the signature of the compromis , shall try to bring the parties into a settlement. Failing such agreement, the judge shall lead the parties to approve, by mutual agreement, the compromis.<br>
                                    § 3 - When the parties fail to agree as to the terms of the compromis , the judge, after hearing the defendant at the same hearing or within 10 days therefrom and pursuant to articles 10 and 21 § 2º of this law, subject to the provisions of the arbitration clause, shall decide the issue.<br>
                                    § 4 - If the arbitration clause has no provision as to the appointment of arbitrators, it will be the judge´s task, after having heard the parties, to rule with respect to this, having the option of nominating a sole arbitrator for the resolution of the conflict.<br>
                                    § 5 - Should the claimant, without reasonable excuse, fails to appear at the hearing to determine the preparation of the compromis , the proceedings shall be deemed to have been terminated without entering into the merits.<br>
                                    § 6 - Should the defendant fails to appear, it will be up to the judge, having heard the claimant, to rule with respect to the content of the compromis , nominating a sole arbitrator.<br>
                                    § 7 - The judge's decision shall be deemed to be the compromis itself.</p>
                                        
                                    <p>Article 8 - An arbitration clause which forms part of a contract shall be treated as an agreement independent of the other terms of the contract. A decision that the contract is null and void shall not entail ipso jure the invalidity of the arbitration clause.</p> 

                                    <p>Sole paragraph - It shall be up to the arbitrator to decide on its own motion or per request of the parties, the issues concerning the existence, validity and efficacy of the arbitration agreement and of the contract which contains the arbitration clause.</p> 

                                    <p>Article 9 - The compromis is the convention by which the parties submit an existing dispute to arbitration by one or more persons, either judicially or extra-judicially.</p>
